# MVP Factory

## Definition

MVP (*M*inimum *V*iable *P*roduct) Factory is a bimonthly event where participants attempt to complete a nugget in teams or by themselves by the end of every month. The themes are language agnostic. The culture is as inclusive and welcoming as any Code & Coffee social event.

## Event Breakdown

### A Typical Month

#### First Event: The Theme

The first event of the month begins with a introduction to a theme. When presenting, please do:

- Keep it short (Maximum of 10 minutes)
- Offer learning resources
- Provide sample ideas
- Briefly explain possible challenges

For example themes, please [visit](THEME_LIST.md).

Afterwards, have everyone stand up and introduce themselves. Devs should:

- Say their name
- Mention their skills (e.g. programming languages)
- Offer their idea (if they have one at this point)

Finally, everyone works on their project until the event ends. Cooperation should be encouraged. MVP Factory is not a competition.

#### Last Event: The Grind

The second event would be a continuation of the first. Devs continue working on their MVP.

### A Typical Year

#### Demo Day

Every 3 or 4 months, devs that have made enough progress on their projects can do a short presentation (5-10 minutes) of their work.

Things to do for this event:

- Sponsored catering
- Reserved an 1 and a half for talks
- Reserve time for socializing
- Announce it only when there are enough speakers

#### Hackaton

Once a year, organize a hackathon.
