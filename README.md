# MVP Factory

:dizzy_face: :arrow_forward: :factory: :arrow_forward: :sparkles: :sunglasses: :sparkles:

## Definition

MVP (*M*inimum *V*iable *P*roduct) Factory would be a bimonthly event, the twice per month kind, where participants would work and aim to complete a nugget in teams or by themselves once per month within a theme. The themes would be language agnostic. The culture should be as inclusive and welcoming as any Code & Coffee social event. However, the events would be primarily for working on an MVP. It would not be a competition as participants would be encouraged to help each other.

## Planned Events

### Theme Introduction

The first event of the month would begin with an introduction to the theme. Having a theme specialist present it would be fantastic. Learning resources, an entry point, project examples and brief explanations of challenging areas would be given. Afterwards, participants would be encouraged to spend only a short amount of time on their idea as it is not the focal point of the event. The goal is to encourage everyone to repeatedly try all sorts new projects.

### Work Continues

The second event would be a continuation of the first. With the theme having already been introduced, participants would simply work on their MVP.

### Demo Day

Every 3 or 4 months, a demo event would be planned. Interested participants would demo their MVPs in a 5-10 minute talk. This event could be catered with the help of sponsors. It could begin with a 30 minute social, then move on to the talks and end with a bit more socializing.

### Yearly Hackathon
